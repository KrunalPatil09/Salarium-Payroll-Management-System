## Technologies

- **Frontend:** Vite, React (or any other framework/library you are using)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** (if applicable, e.g., MongoDB, MySQL)
- **Others:** (any additional libraries or tools)

## Frontend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KrunalPatil09/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Your frontend should be running at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your Vite configuration).

## Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file for environment variables:**

   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

   Add your environment variables as needed (e.g., database connection strings).

4. **Run the server:**

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   Your backend should be running at `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified in your `server.js`).
